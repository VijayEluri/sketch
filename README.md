Eclipse Sketch
=============

The [Sketch](http://www.eclipse.org/sketch/) project was created to support a more flexible modeling activity in Eclipse, enriching user's interaction with graphical editors by taking advantage from the capabilities provided by touch/tablet devices using free-hand sketching recognition. 

Github vs. Eclipse git
----------------------

This project was forked on github in order to easily disseminate the contributions among the community. In fact, the github repository is merely a mirror of the Eclipse repository.

If you want to stay always up-to-date with the latest changes, [fork](https://github.com/ugosan/sketch/fork) the ugosan repository Github.


Contributing
------------

Want to contribute? Great! Follow these steps:

2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b joe_branch`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am "Added something"`)
